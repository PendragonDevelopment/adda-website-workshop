When my mom was 19 years old, she was diagnosed with Lupus and given a limited lifespan - and told she would never have children. 35 years later, both my sister and I are very glad some of that diagnosis turned out to be inaccurate - my mom still has Lupus, but it has been in remission for some ten years now. Fortunately for us, the team that managed her care had the ability to constantly track her progress and keep on top of her treatment.

Most physicians don't have the time to provide the level of care my mom was fortunate enough to receive. They rarely have enough time to get in, talk to their patients, then recommend a course of action which they won't hear results on for 1, 3, even 6 months. There's no way for physicians to easily communicate with their patients to track progress, compliance, and efficacy of their treatment careplans.

Many patients have started keeping track of their care on their own. Using smartphone apps and wearable fitness trackers, many of us have started taking an active role in tracking and measuring our care. But again, there's no easy way to share our data with our physicians and track our progress.

That's where Vitamin C comes in.

We create that bridge, allowing patients to continue to use the tools they're already using and providing that data to their physicians in real time alerts, in-app messages, and pushing that information back into the systems those physicians are already using.

We're already building integrations with electronic medical record systems from Greenway, GE, and Epic - through the Healthkit API - and we believe that by making data instantly available and relevant to a physician's decision making process, we can improve the quality of care delivered. It's your care, made simple.
