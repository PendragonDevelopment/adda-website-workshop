When my mom was 19 years old, she was diagnosed with Lupus and given a limited lifespan - and told she would never have children. 35 years later, both my sister and I are very glad some of that diagnosis turned out to be inaccurate - my mom still has Lupus, but it has been in remission for some ten years now. Fortunately for us, the team that managed her care had the ability to constantly track her progress and keep on top of her treatment. So, for me, improving healthcare is personal

Points:

- Mother, 19, diagnosed with Lupus and told wouldn't have kids
- Still has Lupus, but in remission
- Team that managed her care tracked her progress constantly
- For me, it's personal

Physicians any more rarely have enough time to get in, talk to their patients, then recommend a course of action which they won't hear results on for 1, 3, even 6 months and then there's no way for physicians to easily communicate with their patients to track progress. Many patients have started keeping track of their care on their own using smartphone apps and wearable fitness trackers, and have started taking an active role in tracking and measuring our care. Getting this data to physicians will be crucial with new regulations and meaningful use criteria.

Points:

- Physicians don't have as much time to engage with their patients
- Patients are using their own devices and apps
- Getting that data to physicians is crucial

That's where Vitamin C comes in.
We've built a simple system that turns a population health management project that would take 6 months and $100,000’s to implement into a few hours and at a fraction of the cost. We allow patients to continue to use the tools they're already using and providing that data to their physicians in real time alerts, in-app messages, and pushing that information back into the systems those physicians are already using. We connect with the tools your patients are already using, whether it’s a 70 year old rural citizen without internet access or a twenty five year old using a device with the Healthkit API.

Points:

- Reduces the cost in time and money to implement
- Allows physicians and patients to continue using the tools they're already using
- Emphasize use cases for non-Internet users as well as users with the latest tech

How have we been able to do this?
We have a team with backgrounds in security, healthcare policy, pharma, and finance. This is has allowed us to build a HIPAA compliant product focused on the user's expereince, whether physician or patient. We already have paying customers in our private beta, and we're signing on some of the largest group practices in Georgia. We're already halfway to our goal of getting 100k users by the end of the year, and we're not slowing down. We’re also in negotiation with three of the top five pharma companies in the United States, paving the way to secure partnerships that will help simplify the care you receive.

Points:

- Team backgrounds: Security, Healthcare policy, pharma, finance
- HIPAA compliant, huge focus on UX
- Paying customers
- Signing largest group practices in GA
- Halfway to year end goal of 100k users
- Negotiations with 3 of 5 largest pharma companies in US

Because that's what Vitamin C is: your care, made simple.
